To do:

- favicons doesnt work anymore
- ephy-dnd.c we still need it ?
- implement phoenix like popup blocking
- urls like www.gnome.org and gnome.org should use same folder in history
- history scoring for autocompletion

Done:

* simpler crash recover
* open url on middle click
* tree views are borked, maybe the new api doesnt return a list of rows
* dont autocomplete on www.
* simplify/clean autocompletion entry code
* favicons should not be fetched on load end
* open bookmarks, close galeon -> crash
