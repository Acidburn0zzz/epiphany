To do:

Bookmarks:
- Implement "epiphany --bookmarks" command line switch that opens a bme window only (also add a .desktop file to the applications menu)
- closing the last ephy browser window shouldn't close the bme window
- Good editor menu layout, accells ...
- All bookmarks dialogs need to use ephy_state for default/user persisted size
- Select All menu, useful to open several windows at a time
- Space should toggle topics checkboxes, maybe also click on the title ?
- Fix import to s/folder/topic again
- context menu on topics list
- The keyword field of the bookmark need to be updated topic set/unset,
  otherwise completion will not work
- Consistent use of topics instead of keywords in the code
- Drag topics on the toolbar
- Topics/bookmarks should be organized alphabetically and case-insensitively.
- Support several special folders: I guess we need to make the All node
  property more generic.
- "Most used" topic. Note that here the topic term doesnt work well :/
- "Not categorized" topic. Same prob as above.
- Do we need "All" ? (daveb says yes, its a database, we should provide a way to access and search the whole thing)

Others:
- if you change mozilla settings when ephy is not running, they arent updated in prefs.js
- downloader should resize when clicking details, so that the cursor is not moved away from the button
- make popups less annoying
- show when bookmarks has updated content
- temporary bookmarks, maybe an expire checkbox in new bookmark dialog ? (I could be on crack here, would be nice to find a good solution though)

Egg problems:
- not translated
- popups not working
- idle not removed when finalizing menu merge
- action reffed in menu merge and never unrefed
- disconnect_proxy does menu stuff without checking it's actually a menu

Done:

* simpler crash recover
* open url on middle click
* tree views are borked, maybe the new api doesnt return a list of rows
* dont autocomplete on www.
* simplify/clean autocompletion entry code
* favicons should not be fetched on load end
* open bookmarks, close galeon -> crash
* favicons doesnt work anymore
* ephy-dnd.c we still need it ?
* autocompletion refine borked for bookmarks
* history scoring for autocompletion
* urls like www.gnome.org and gnome.org should use same folder in history
* drop items from history when they are not visited since some time
* create print preview toolbar only when necessary
* titles in history for hosts too
* history shows empty hosts sometimes !?
* save bookmarks dialog state (current keyword)
* embed dialogs crashes when the window has been closed
* not translated menus
