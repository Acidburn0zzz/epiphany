To do:

- make popups less annoying
- embed dialogs crashes when the window has been closed
- show when bookmarks has updated content
- temporary bookmarks, maybe an expire checkbox in new bookmark dialog ? (I could be on crack here, would be nice to find a good solution though)

Egg problems:
- popups not working
- idle not removed when finalizing menu merge
- action reffed in menu merge and never unrefed
- disconnect_proxy does menu stuff without checking it's actually a menu

Done:

* simpler crash recover
* open url on middle click
* tree views are borked, maybe the new api doesnt return a list of rows
* dont autocomplete on www.
* simplify/clean autocompletion entry code
* favicons should not be fetched on load end
* open bookmarks, close galeon -> crash
* favicons doesnt work anymore
* ephy-dnd.c we still need it ?
* autocompletion refine borked for bookmarks
* history scoring for autocompletion
* urls like www.gnome.org and gnome.org should use same folder in history
* drop items from history when they are not visited since some time
* create print preview toolbar only when necessary
* titles in history for hosts too
* history shows empty hosts sometimes !?
* save bookmarks dialog state (current keyword)
