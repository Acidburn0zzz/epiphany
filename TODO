To do:

- implement phoenix like popup blocking / make popups less annoying
- loading feedback on tabs
- create print preview toolbar only when necessary
- embed dialogs crashes when the window has been closed
- save bookmarks dialog state (current keyword)
- show bookmarks updated content
- temporary bookmarks, maybe an expire checkbox in new bookmark dialog ?

Done:

* simpler crash recover
* open url on middle click
* tree views are borked, maybe the new api doesnt return a list of rows
* dont autocomplete on www.
* simplify/clean autocompletion entry code
* favicons should not be fetched on load end
* open bookmarks, close galeon -> crash
* favicons doesnt work anymore
* ephy-dnd.c we still need it ?
* autocompletion refine borked for bookmarks
* history scoring for autocompletion
* urls like www.gnome.org and gnome.org should use same folder in history
* drop items from history when they are not visited since some time
