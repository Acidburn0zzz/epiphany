Bookmarks:
- Consistent use of topics instead of keywords in the code
- Consistent use of address instead of location in the code where appropriate
- <campd> nautilus/libnautilus-private/nautilus-tree-view-drag-dest.c. Dest crashes.

Others:
- if you change mozilla settings when ephy is not running, they arent updated in prefs.js
- downloader should resize when clicking details, so that the cursor is not moved away from the button
- make popups less annoying
- show when bookmarks has updated content
- temporary bookmarks, maybe an expire checkbox in new bookmark dialog ? (I could be on crack here, would be nice to find a good solution though)

Egg problems:
- not translated
- popups not working
- idle not removed when finalizing menu merge
- action reffed in menu merge and never unrefed
- disconnect_proxy does menu stuff without checking it's actually a menu
