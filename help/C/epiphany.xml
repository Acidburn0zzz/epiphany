    <para>&fr; is a GNOME web browser based on the mozilla rendering 
	engine. A web browser is more than an application, it is a way 
	of thinking, it is a way of seeing the world. Epiphany's 
	principles are simplicity and standards compliance.

      <para>Simplicity:</para>
      <para>
Epiphany aims to utilize the simplest interface possible for a browser.  Keep
in mind that simple does not necessarily mean less powerful.  We believe
the commonly used browsers of today are too big, buggy, and bloated. Epiphany
addresses simplicity with a small browser designed for the web -- not mail,
newsgroups, file management, instant messenging or coffee making.  The UNIX
philosophy is to design small tools that do one thing, and do it well.

Epiphany also address simplicity with modularity to make a light and powerful
application.  If something can be implemented using external applications
or components, we use it rather than wasting resources in the web browser.
Integration will be achived with CORBA, Bonobo, and the ever popular
command line.  

Mail will be handled with your favorite e-mail application (Evolution, pine,
mutt, balsa, pronto, whatever).

    <listitem>
      <para>Standards compliance:</para>
      <para>
The introduction of non-standard features in browsers could make it difficult
or impossible to use alternative products like Epiphany if developers embrace
them.  Alternative (standards complying) browsers could not be able to
fully access web sites making use of these features.  The success of
non-standard features can ultimately lead to forcing one browser, on
one platform to dominate the market. Standards compliance ensures the 
freedom of choice.  Epiphany aims to achieve this.

            <para>HIG compliance</para>
              <para>
Epiphany is going to follow version 1.0 of the gnome 
user guidelines. Unless there are very seriuos reasons to make an 
exception not following it will be considered a bug. 
"I follow the HIG only when I like it" is not a legitimate approach. 
Any areas where we diverge from the HIG will communicated 
to the HIG team for future consideration.

            <para>Gnome integration</para>
            <para>
Epiphany's main goal is to be integrated with the gnome desktop. 
We dont aim to make epiphany usable outside Gnome. If someone will like 
to use it anyway, it's just a plus. Ex: Making people happy that 
don't have control center installed is not a good reason 
to have mime configuration in epiphany itself.

Feature bloat and user interface clutter is evil :)

            <para>
We will follow the new gnome policy about preferences. 
I think Havoc Pennington already explained it a lot 
better than I could ever do.

            <para>User target</para>
            <para>
We target non-technical users by design. 
This happens to be 90% of the user population.
(Technical details should not exposed in the interface)
We target web users, we dont directly target web developers.
A few geek-oriented feautures can be kept as 
long as they are non-obtrusive.
