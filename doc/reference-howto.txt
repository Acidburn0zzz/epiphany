Documenting Epiphany Reference
==============================

Documenting Epiphany's API is fairly trivial following these instructions:

- Add documentation headers to the .c file public functions, some pointers:
  + good examples can be found in WebKit/WebKit/gtk/ files and epiphany itself
  + don't forget to match arg names in the .c and .h files
  + add a SECTION comment at the beginning of the file

- If it's a GObject add the get_type function and include the .h in 
  doc/reference/epiphany.types in case it's not there already

- Remove the .h from the IGNORE_HFILES section of doc/reference/Makefile.am

- Clean current docs build using:
  + make maintainer-clean-local

- Build and commit:
  + modified .c and .h files
  + modified Makefile.am
  + modified epiphany-docs.sgml
  + modified epiphany.types

  Remember that the generated files shouldn't be committed.
  Don't forget to prefix your commit with 'docs:'
