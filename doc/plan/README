Epiphany Plan README


ITEM STATUS INFORMATION
=======================

Each <item> needs to have a status assigned; possible values are:

    orphan
    pending
    delayed
    designed
    implementing
    completed


HTML TRANSFORMATION
===================

The XSLT stylesheet shipped with the plan, plan2table.xsl, will
transform the plan's XML into a nice HTML table by using:

    xsltproc -o plan.html plan2table.xsl plan.xml


VALIDATION
==========

There's a DTD associated with the Epiphany plan, ephyplan.dtd.
To prevent typos, you could validate the plan before commiting changes
to CVS by using:

    xmllint --noout --valid plan.xml

You could also simply run "make" in this directory, which will
validate the xml input file first, and then transform it to html.
