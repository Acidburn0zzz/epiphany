In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

- use 8-space tabs for indentation
- curly brackets are on a new line
- please compare with NULL or FALSE isntead of using "!"
- callback functions have a suffix _cb
- all files have to be encoded in UTF-8

  Comment blocks are written like this:
  
/*
 * bla_bla_cb: This is an example comment block
 */

See ChangeLog.README for SVN checkin rules.

Do NOT commit to this module without permission from a maintainer.
