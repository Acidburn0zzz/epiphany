CODE STYLE
==========

In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

- Use 2-space no-tabs for indentation (mandatory on new files, old
  ones will be re-indented eventually. When modifying an existing file
  with 8-space indentation keep the old style please).

- Use K&R style for the braces.

- No braces for one line control clauses.

- Callback functions have a suffix _cb.

- All files have to be encoded in UTF-8.

- Use char/int/double/..., not gchar/gint/gdouble/... types.

- All implementation files must include first "config.h", followed by
  the primary header, followed by a blank line, followed by all the
  local headers sorted alphabetically, followed by a blank line,
  followed by all the system headers sorted alphabetically.

  Headers should follow the same pattern excluding the config.h and
  self file section, for obvious reasons.

- Make comments full sentences. This means proper capitalization and
  punctuation.

- data/kr-gnome-indent.cfg is provided as a reference config file for the
  uncrustify program to get correct indentation in new files.

- There's no space between a type cast and the variable name.

  Right: (int *)foo
  Wrong: (int*) foo

=========
DEBUGGING
=========

To enable debugging use the configure option --enable-debug.

LOGGING
=======

At execution time, you must enable the log service. To enable the
log service, set the environment variable: EPHY_LOG_MODULES

EPHY_LOG_MODULES variable has the form:

	<moduleName>[:<moduleName>]*

moduleName is a filename.
ex: export EPHY_LOG_MODULES=ephy-window.c:ephy-autocompletion.c
The special log module "all" enables all log modules.

Use the LOG macro to put debug messages in the code.

WARNINGS
========

At execution time, you must enable the service. To enable you to debug
warnings, set the environment variable: EPHY_DEBUG_BREAK

Possible value for EPHY_DEBUG_BREAK variable:

	stack		Prints a stack trace.

	suspend		Use this to stop execution when a warning occurs.
			You can then attach a debugger to the process.

	trap		Use this while running epiphany in a debugger.
			This makes execution stop and gives back control to
			the debugger.


PROFILING
=========

At execution time, you must enable the profiling service. To enable the
profiling service, set the environment variable: EPHY_PROFILING_MODULES

EPHY_PROFILE_MODULES variable has the form:

	<moduleName>[:<moduleName>]*

moduleName is a filename.
ex: export EPHY_PROFILE_MODULES=ephy-window.c:ephy-autocompletion.c
The special profiling module "all" enables all profiling modules.

Use START_PROFILER STOP_PROFILER macros to profile pieces of code.
