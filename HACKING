In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

- use 2-space no-tabs for indentation (mandatory on new files, old ones will
  be re-indented eventually. When modifying an existing file with 8-space
  indentation keep the old style please)
- Use K&R style for the braces
- please compare with NULL or FALSE isntead of using "!"
- callback functions have a suffix _cb
- all files have to be encoded in UTF-8

- data/kr-gnome-indent.cfg is provided as a reference config file for the
  uncrustify program to get correct indentation in new files.

  Comment blocks are written like this:
  
/*
 * bla_bla_cb: This is an example comment block
 */
