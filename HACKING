In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

- use 8-space tabs for indentation
- curly brackets are on a new line
- please compare with NULL or FALSE isntead of using "!"
- callback functions have a suffix _cb
- all files have to be encoded in UTF-8

  Comment blocks are written like this:
  
/*
 * bla_bla_cb: This is an example comment block
 */

SVN Checkin rules:

When committing a patch to svn, you must use a checkin comment that fully
describes the changes made. If the checkin is related to a bug, reference
the bug number. Example:

        When removing a toolbar, make its items available again in the toolbar
        editor. (Bug #131182)

Checkin comments MUST use the UTF-8 encoding.

If you forget to check in some changes that belonged in the same commit (e.g. omitted
a file), you must copy the checkin comment from the previous, incomplete checkin, and
additionally reference that commit's svn revision number. DO NOT use meaningless checkin
comments such as "forgotten file" !
If you make a major mistake in the checkin comment (e.g empty, or you've forgotten to cite
the bug numbers), you must create a new checkin that touches all files the original checkin
changed (just using whitespace changes is ok), and in the new checkin comment must note that
this new checkin fixes the original checkin, referencing it by its SVN revision number.

Do NOT commit to this module without permission from a maintainer. See the MAINTAINERS file
for who they are.
